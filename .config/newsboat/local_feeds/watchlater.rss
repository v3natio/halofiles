    <title>How To Solve The 6s Challenge</title>
    <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2vkrxvh76c</link>
    <description>Can you make 6 from 3 copies of the same number, where the number ranges from 0 to 10? You can use common mathematical operations, but you cannot introduce any new digits (so the cube root is not allowed), and you must have an equality (this is not a trick question with the "not equal" sign). This is a great exercise for building mathematical number sense! See the video for the many solutions.</description>
